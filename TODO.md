# Complaint Management System - Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Project: UniResolve AI - Complaint Management System with Next.js frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
- Current Features: User authentication (NextAuth), complaint submission with file uploads (Multer), admin dashboard for status updates, tracking pages.
- Technologies: Next.js/TypeScript, Express/MongoDB, Tailwind CSS with dark mode.
- Files Analyzed: Frontend pages (submit, admin, track, users), backend models (Complaint.js, User.js), routes (complaints.js, auth.js, etc.), components (providers.tsx), layout, middleware.
- Current State: Basic CRUD operations, authentication working, but lacks interactivity, AI, real-time features, gamification, advanced analytics.

## Plan
- **Phase 1: UI/UX Enhancements**
  - Add animations, micro-interactions, and unique design elements using Tailwind CSS and possibly Framer Motion.
  - Improve dark mode support and add theme toggles.
  - Enhance mobile responsiveness and add PWA capabilities.
- **Phase 2: AI Integration**
  - Implement auto-categorization of complaints using NLP (e.g., via OpenAI API or similar).
  - Add sentiment analysis for complaints.
  - Predictive analytics for complaint trends.
- **Phase 3: Real-Time Features**
  - Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets (Socket.io).
  - Add live updates for complaint status changes.
  - Email/SMS notifications integration.
- **Phase 4: Gamification**
  - Add user points system for submissions and resolutions.
  - Implement badges and leaderboards.
  - User profiles with achievements.
- **Phase 5: Productivity Features**
  - Bulk actions for admins (e.g., update multiple complaints).
  - Advanced filters and search.
  - Export options (CSV, PDF).
- **Phase 6: Analytics Dashboard**
  - Create detailed analytics with charts (using Chart.js or Recharts).
  - Reports on complaint categories, resolution times, user activity.
- **Phase 7: Additional Features**
  - Voice input for complaints.
  - Image recognition for attachments.
  - Chat support and FAQ chatbot.
  - Collaborative features (e.g., assign complaints to teams).
- **Phase 8: Backend Enhancements**
  - Update models for new fields (e.g., points, badges, categories).
  - Add new routes for analytics, gamification.
  - Integrate third-party services (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email).
- **Phase 9: Testing and Optimization**
  - Unit and integration tests.
  - Performance optimization.
  - Accessibility improvements.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- Frontend: All pages (submit/page.tsx, admin/page.tsx, etc.), components (new ones for charts, notifications), layout.tsx, globals.css.
- Backend: Models (Complaint.js, User.js - add fields for gamification), Routes (new routes for analytics, notifications), server.js (add Socket.io).
- New Files: AI service files, gamification models, analytics components, WebSocket handlers.
- Config: package.json (add dependencies like socket.io, chart.js, openai), tailwind.config.js (for animations).

## Followup Steps
- Install new dependencies (e.g., npm install socket.io, framer-motion, recharts, openai).
- Set up environment variables for AI APIs, email/SMS services.
- Test each phase incrementally.
- Deploy and monitor performance.
- Gather user feedback for further iterations.
