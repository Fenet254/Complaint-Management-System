# Complaint Management System - Real-World Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Project: UniResolve AI - Complaint Management System with Next.js frontend and Node.js/Express backend.
- Current Features: User authentication (NextAuth), complaint submission with file uploads (Multer), admin dashboard for status updates, tracking pages.
- Technologies: Next.js/TypeScript, Express/MongoDB, Tailwind CSS with dark mode, OpenAI, Socket.io.
- Files Analyzed: Frontend pages (submit, admin, track, users), backend models (Complaint.js, User.js), routes (complaints.js, auth.js, etc.), components (providers.tsx), layout, middleware.
- Current State: Basic CRUD operations, authentication working, but lacks interactivity, AI, real-time features, gamification, advanced analytics. UI needs professional redesign with multiple dashboards. Complaint categories need expansion for students (academic, facilities, admin, financial, harassment, tech) and workers (workplace, resources, admin).

## Plan
- **Phase 1: University Integration**
  - Create API endpoints for linking with university portals (e.g., student ID auto-verification).
  - Integrate with ERP systems for seamless complaint routing to departments.
  - Add OAuth for university SSO.
- **Phase 2: Mobile-First and Accessibility**
  - Enhance PWA capabilities with offline support and push notifications.
  - Develop React Native mobile app for on-the-go submissions.
  - Ensure WCAG compliance for accessibility (screen readers, keyboard navigation).
- **Phase 3: Anonymity and Privacy**
  - Implement anonymous submission options with blockchain-like hashing for tracking.
  - Add GDPR/FERPA compliance features (data anonymization, consent management).
  - Encrypt sensitive data and add audit logs.
- **Phase 4: AI-Driven Insights**
  - Enhance AI for pattern recognition in complaints (e.g., recurring cafeteria issues).
  - Implement auto-escalation to leadership based on AI analysis.
  - Add proactive suggestions and trend predictions.
- **Phase 5: Community and Feedback Loops**
  - Build forums for peer discussions and shared experiences.
  - Add post-resolution surveys and feedback collection.
  - Implement user feedback to iterate on features.
- **Phase 6: Scalability and Deployment**
  - Deploy to cloud (AWS/Azure) with auto-scaling and load balancing.
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines and monitoring (Sentry for errors).
  - Support multi-university deployments with tenant isolation.
- **Phase 7: Partnerships and Monetization**
  - Collaborate with student unions and universities for funding.
  - Offer premium features (e.g., advanced analytics, priority support).
  - Integrate with third-party services for monetization.
- **Phase 8: User Training and Adoption**
  - Create tutorials, onboarding flows, and in-app guides.
  - Develop marketing materials for social media and university events.
  - Track adoption metrics and user engagement.
- **Phase 9: Sustainability**
  - Implement green coding practices (optimize energy usage).
  - Reduce paper-based complaints through digital adoption.
  - Add environmental impact tracking.
- **Phase 10: Pilot and Iterate**
  - Deploy pilot at one university, gather metrics (resolution time reduction).
  - Iterate based on feedback and scale to more institutions.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- TODO.md: Updated with new phases.
- package.json (frontend/backend): Add new dependencies (e.g., bcrypt for hashing, react-discussion-board for forums).
- Models: Update Complaint.js and User.js for new fields (anonymity, feedback, categories).
- Frontend: Redesign pages for professional UI, add multiple dashboards (student, worker, community).
- Backend: Add new routes for integrations, forums, analytics.

## Followup steps
- Install new dependencies.
- Redesign UI to be professional with multiple dashboards.
- Expand complaint categories.
- Implement phases step-by-step.
- Test and optimize.
