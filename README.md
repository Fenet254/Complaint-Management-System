🎓 Complaint Management System
The Complaint Management System is a digital platform built to help university students report, track, and resolve issues they face on campus — from academic concerns to facility problems. It’s designed to make student voices heard and ensure complaints are handled transparently and efficiently.
💬 Why It Matters
University life comes with challenges, and students often struggle to get timely support. This system bridges that gap by:
- 📥 Making it easy to submit complaints online
- 📊 Organizing issues by type, urgency, and status
- 🔄 Keeping students informed about progress and resolution
- 📈 Helping administrators spot patterns and improve services
Whether it’s a broken lab projector, a grading dispute, or a cafeteria issue — this tool ensures every concern gets the attention it deserves.
🛠️ Built For Students, By Students
This project is part of a student-led initiative to improve campus life through technology. It’s lightweight, customizable, and ready to be deployed in any university setting. The codebase includes:
- A backend for complaint storage and processing
- A dashboard for tracking and managing submissions
- A clean structure for future improvements (e.g., notifications, analytics)
